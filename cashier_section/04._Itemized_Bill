Sometimes certain patients may request for an itemized bill.

The Itemized Bill will show the detailed bill for the patient.

It includes all the charges from Lab, Pharmacy, Procedures and the Nurses Billing Sheet. 
(It does NOT include the Consultation and Registration Fee)

The itemized bill does not have a link for receiving payments.
 You will have to use the Summary Receipt(s) Section.
